    // ‚ÑπÔ∏è Even though there is a `OKGameStateDelegate` protocol, `OKGameState` only exposes a `delegate` for formality but it does not use it. The reason is that in certain situations, an `OKGameState` may have more than one "delegate" that it needs to send notifications to, e.g. both an outgoing scene and an incoming scene in the case of visual scene transition effects with a long duration. The `delegate` property may be opened as a future customization point.
