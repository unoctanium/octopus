// TODO: Tests
// CHECK: Implement a cached list of entities for each component type?

// ‚ÑπÔ∏è DESIGN: Pause/unpause should be handled by scene code rather than `OKGameCoordinator` or `OKGameState`, as the scene may be automatically paused by the system when the player receives a call or pulls up the iOS Control Center, for example, but that does not necessarily mean that the GAME has entered a different GAME STATE.
// However, if the player manually pauses, then the scene may signal the `OKGameCoordinator` to enter a "Paused" state, which may or may not then cause a scene transition.

// üôÅ NOTE: This is a large class, but we cannot break it up into multiple files because "Overriding non-@objc declarations from extensions is not supported" as of 2018/03, and other issues with organizing code via extensions: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/1767
