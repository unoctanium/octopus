public typealias OctopusGameCoordinator = OKGameCoordinator

/// Coordinates all the possible states and scenes of a game, and manages top-level state and game-specific data that must persist across different game states.
///
/// One of the core objects for an OctopusKit game, along with `OctopusKit` and `OKViewController`.
///
/// This is a "controller" in the MVC sense; use this class to maintain global objects such as the game world, player data, and network connections etc. You may use `OKGameCoordinator` as-is and add components to its `entity`, or subclass it to add complex top-level functionality specific to your game.
///
/// **Usage**
///
/// 1. Your application's launch cycle must initialize an instance of `OKGameCoordinator` or its subclass, specifying a list of all possible states your game can be in, represented by `OKGameState`. Each state must have an `OKGameScene` associated with, as well as an optional `SwiftUI` overlay view. See the documentation for `OKGameCoordinator`.
///
///     ```
///     let myGameCoordinator = OKGameCoordinator(
///         states: [MyOKGameStateSubclassA(),
///                  PlayState(),
///                  PausedState(),
///                  GameOverState() ],
///         initialStateClass: PlayState.self)
///     ```
///     or use a subclass:
///     ```
///     OctopusKit(gameCoordinator: MyCustomGameCoordinator())
///     ```
///     or simply, if your game has a single scene:
///     ```
///     let myGameCoordinator = OKGameCoordinator(
///         states: [OKGameState(associatedSceneClass:  MyScene.self,
///                                   associatedSwiftUIView: MyUI() ) ])
///     ```
///
/// 2. Call `OctopusKit(gameCoordinator:)` to initialize the `OctopusKit.shared` singleton instance, which all other objects will refer to when they need to access the game coordinator and other top-level objects.
///
/// 3. Use an `OKViewController` in your UI hierarchy to present the game coordinator's scenes.
///
/// - NOTE: The recommended way to setup and present an OctopusKit game is to use the `OKContainerView` for **SwiftUI**.
