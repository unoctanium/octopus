// TODO: An option for only tracking a pointer if the node has the highest `zPosition`, and maybe only nodes with an entity that has a `NodePointerStateComponent` should count.

// PERFORMANCE: May need optimization?

import SpriteKit
import GameplayKit

/// An intermediary component which tracks a pointer (touch or mouse) if it begins in the entity's `NodeComponent` node, and updates its state depending on the position of the pointer in relation to the node's bounds.
///
/// Other components can simply query this component's `state`, `latestEventForCurrentFrame` and other properties to implement pointer-controlled behavior, such as moving a node while it's being touched or updating a sprite's visual state when it's clicked, without having to directly track touches or the mouse pointer.
///
/// - IMPORTANT: To ensure that the state reported by this component remains valid even if the node is modified during the frame, other components should call the `updateState(...)` method after modifying the node or before using this component's state.
///
/// - NOTE: Whereas a `PointerEventComponent` should generally be added to a scene and then linked to other entities via `RelayComponent`s, a `NodePointerStateComponent` should be added to every entity whose nodes represent a visually interactive area in the scene, such as buttons.
///
/// - NOTE: This component only tracks a single pointer by design; e.g. the first touch that begins inside the entity's `NodeComponent` node. For multi-touch gestures, use components based on gesture-recognizers.
