// CHECK: Enforce `isUserInteractionEnabled`?
// CHECK: Add an option for `force` sensitivity?
// CHECK: Add an option for "dead zone" radius tolerance?
// CHECK: Behavior on physics bodies.

// CHECKED: This component works whether the `PointerEventComponent` is added to a sprite entity or the scene entity (via a `RelayComponent`) :)

// TODO: FIX or WARN: Using `initialNodePosition` to determine the final position at the end of the dragging gesture does not account for changes in position by external forces during the gesture (e.g. physics.)
// TODO: Verify documentation and comments that were copied from TouchControlledDraggingComponent but are not relevant here.

// PERFORMANCE: May need optimization?

// üí°üí¨ NOTE: It's possible to make the node move only when the pointer moves out through its edges, by writing:
//
//  let nodePositionAndCenterDelta = node.position - node.frame.center
//  node.position = (currentPointerLocation - initialNodeCenterAndPointerPositionDelta) + nodePositionAndCenterDelta
//
//  But that does not make the pointer be able to move around inside the node again without moving it. This could be a technique to improve and use for something else.

        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE: Do not move the node by comparing the `location` and `previousLocation` of the pointer. That does not seem to be accurate, and can cause "drifts" where the "pointer" ends up in a different point in the node than where it started pointing the node, at least in the iOS Simulator. Instead, store the initial position of the node, then compare the initial position of the pointer with its latest position, and directly set the node's position to the final translation. This works the same way as the `translation` property of a `UIPanGestureRecognizer`: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipangesturerecognizer/1621207-translation
        
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è PERFORMANCE: Calculating the translation here should be faster than accessing the `NodePointerStateComponent.pointerTranslationInParent` computed property which checks for and unwraps many optionals (node, parent, etc.)

        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è After the node moves, the state of the `NodePointerStateComponent` may no longer be correct. e.g. if the pointer moves too fast, it may be outside the node's bounds, so the state will be `pointingOutside`. When this component moves the node to the pointer's location, the state should be restored back to `pointing`, so that other components which are affected by `NodePointerStateComponent` can function correctly, e.g. so they don't show a `pointingOutside` behavior or visual effect for a single frame.
        
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è When the user performs a dragging operation, a "tap" operation is not expected, so we will instruct the `NodePointerStateComponent` to not enter a `tapped` or `endedOutside` state when the user lifts the pointer after moving the node.
