Same issue with `preciseLocation(in:)` and `precisePreviousLocation(in:)`
        
        // ⚠️ BUG: 20180504B: APPLEBUG RADAR 39997859: `UITouch.location(in:)` and `UITouch.preciseLocation(in:)` for a touch "wobbles" when a 2nd touch moves near it, even if the tracked touch is stationary. ⚠️ Seems to be a problem since iOS 11.3 on all devices, in all apps, including system apps like Photos.
