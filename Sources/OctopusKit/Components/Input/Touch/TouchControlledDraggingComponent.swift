// CHECK: Enforce `isUserInteractionEnabled`?
// CHECK: Add an option for `force` sensitivity?
// CHECK: Add an option for "dead zone" radius tolerance?
// CHECK: Behavior on physics bodies.

// CHECKED: This component works whether the `TouchEventComponent` is added to a sprite entity or the scene entity (via a `RelayComponent`) :)

// TODO: BUG: Fix multitouch handling even if not tracking multiple touches. (BUG 20180504B, RADAR 39997859)
// TODO: FIX or WARN: Using `initialNodePosition` to determine the final position at the end of the dragging gesture does not account for changes in position by external forces during the gesture (e.g. physics.)

// PERFORMANCE: May need optimization?

// üí°üí¨ NOTE: It's possible to make the node move only when the touch moves out through its edges, by writing:
//
//  let nodePositionAndCenterDelta = node.position - node.frame.center
//  node.position = (currentTouchLocation - initialNodeCenterAndTouchPositionDelta) + nodePositionAndCenterDelta
//
//  But that does not make the touch be able to move around inside the node again without moving it. This could be a technique to improve and use for something else.

Same issue with `preciseLocation(in:)` and `precisePreviousLocation(in:)`

        // ‚ö†Ô∏è BUG: 20180504B: APPLEBUG RADAR 39997859: `UITouch.location(in:)` and `UITouch.preciseLocation(in:)` for a touch "wobbles" when a 2nd touch moves near it, even if the tracked touch is stationary. ‚ö†Ô∏è Seems to be a problem since iOS 11.3 on all devices, in all apps, including system apps like Photos.
    
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE: Do not move the node by comparing the `location` and `previousLocation` of the touch. That does not seem to be accurate, and can cause "drifts" where the "pointer" ends up in a different point in the node than where it started touching the node, at least in the iOS Simulator. Instead, store the initial position of the node, then compare the initial position of the touch with its latest position, and directly set the node's position to the final translation. This works the same way as the `translation` property of a `UIPanGestureRecognizer`: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipangesturerecognizer/1621207-translation
        
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è PERFORMANCE: Calculating the translation here should be faster than accessing the `NodeTouchStateComponent.touchTranslationInParent` computed property which checks for and unwraps many optionals (node, parent, etc.)

        isDragging = true
        
        // #6: Update the interaction state.
        
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è After the node moves, the state of the `NodeTouchStateComponent` may no longer be correct. e.g. if the touch moves too fast, it may be outside the node's bounds, so the state will be `touchingOutside`. When this component moves the node to the touch's location, the state should be restored back to `touching`, so that other components which are affected by `NodeTouchStateComponent` can function correctly, e.g. so they don't show a `touchingOutside` behavior or visual effect for a single frame.
        
        // ‚ÑπÔ∏è When the user performs a dragging operation, a "tap" operation is not expected, so we will instruct the `NodeTouchStateComponent` to not enter a `tapped` or `endedOutside` state when the user lifts the touch after moving the node.
