/// An abstract base class for components in a turn-based game. May be used in conjunction with `OKTurnBasedScene` or updated manually.
///
/// Turn-based components still have a per-frame `update(deltaTime:)` cycle and may perform per-frame updates like all other components, but they also have special methods that must be manually called to perform tasks for each discrete game-defined turn.
///
/// - IMPORTANT: Turn-based components must also be added to the component systems list of an `OKTurnBasedScene` to be updated in a deterministic order.

    // ðŸ’¡ TIP: Use game states to implement turn order for games that require the begin/update/end cycle.
    // EXAMPLE: `TurnBeginState`, `TurnUpdateState`, `TurnEndState`, all handled by a single scene.
    // A component that manages player control and/or turn logic would signal the game coordinator to transition to different states, and the scene would call `self.beginTurn()`, `self.updateTurn()` and `self.endTurn()` in OKScene.gameCoordinatorDidEnterState(_:from:)
    
    // DESIGN: CHECKED: Should this be a protocol with default implementations? No, as it would not be consistent with the `override` for regular `update(deltaTime:)` etc. :)
