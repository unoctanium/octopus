// Renders a circular pulsating wave effect with fluctuating colors, ignoring any current pixel colors
// Uniform: u_speed, how fast the wave should travel. Ranges from -2 to 2 work best, where negative numbers cause waves to come inwards; try starting with 1.
// Uniform: u_brightness, how bright the colors should be. Ranges from 0 to 5 work best; try starting with 0.5 and experiment.
// Uniform: u_strength, how intense the waves should be. Ranges from 0.02 to 5 work best; try starting with 2.
// Uniform: u_density, how large each wave should be. Ranges from 20 to 500 work best; try starting with 100.
// Uniform: u_center, a CGPoint representing the center of the gradient, where 0.5/0.5 is dead center
// Uniform: u_red, how much red to apply to the colors. Specify 0 to 1 to apply that amount of red, or use any negative number (e.g. -1) to have the amount of red fluctuate.
//
// This works by calculating what a color gradient would look like over the space of the node
// then calculating the pixel's distance from the center of the wave. From there we can calculate
// the brightness of the pixel by taking the cosine the wave density and speed to create a nice and
// smooth effect.
